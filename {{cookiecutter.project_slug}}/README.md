Your markdown has a couple of typos in the template variable names. The correct Jinja2 syntax for cookiecutter variables is `{{cookiecutter.variable_name}}`. In your markdown, you have:

```
# 💳 Project: {{cookeiecutter.project_slug}}
{{cookeiecutter.description}}
```

These should be:

```
# 💳 Project: {{cookiecutter.project_slug}}
{{cookiecutter.description}}
```

Everywhere else, you use `{{cookiecutter.project_slug}}` correctly.

**Summary:**  
- Use `{{cookiecutter.project_slug}}` and `{{cookiecutter.description}}` (not `{{cookeiecutter...}}`).
- The rest of your markdown is syntactically correct for cookiecutter template variables.

**Corrected snippet:**
```markdown
# 💳 Project: {{cookiecutter.project_slug}}
{{cookiecutter.description}}
```

### 5️⃣ Running Tests 🧪

&nbsp;&nbsp;Tests are located in the [`tests/`](tests/) directory and use [pytest](https://docs.pytest.org/):

&nbsp;&nbsp;```bash
&nbsp;&nbsp;pytest
&nbsp;&nbsp;```

### 6️⃣ Using Docker (Optional) 🐳

&nbsp;&nbsp;A [Dockerfile](Dockerfile) is provided for containerized development:

&nbsp;&nbsp;```bash
&nbsp;&nbsp;docker build -t my-credit-risk-model .
&nbsp;&nbsp;docker run -it my-credit-risk-model
&nbsp;&nbsp;```
